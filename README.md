Some random shell scripts that I need to make more generic, don't necessarily want to though

##fightMe.sh
* Downloads weeks 27-48 from year 2015 of the [pga tour world rankings](http://www.owgr.com/)
* Uses wget in a for loop v basic stuff

##rename.sh
* Used to rename ``` .xlsx ``` from the ``` fightMe.sh ``` script to like the week number only
* Also renames the downloaded csvs from drive to ``` 2015_w ```
* Needs to more generic tbh but not for now
